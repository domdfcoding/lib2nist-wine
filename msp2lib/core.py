"""
Convert an MSP file representing one or more Mass Spectra to a NIST MS Search user library.

Docker must be installed to use this program.

The first time this script is run it will download the latest
version of the docker image automatically.

This can also be done manually, such as to upgrade to the latest version,
by running with the ``--get-docker-image`` flag.
